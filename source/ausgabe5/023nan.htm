            <p><span class="erklaerung">The following interview was done with 
              the library action figure &quot;Nancy Pearl&quot;. It is a work 
              of fiction and meant to be fun. We know there is a real person </span><a href="http://www.nancypearl.com/" class="erklaerung">Nancy 
              Pearl</a><span class="erklaerung">, who wrote books on <em>Book 
              Lust</em> but this little piece is strictly focused on an action 
              figure accompanied by some books we came across this spring. <br>
              Any contingently resemblance to any real or fictional person is 
              <strong>not</strong> intentional. We just play around because that 
              is what action figures are made for. </span></p>
            
            <p align="left"><span class="text"><br>
              Hello Nancy, it is such a pleasure to meet you, we just can't tell..!</span></p>
