            <p class="text">It must be a sign of my advancing senility, but it 
              was not until I was halfway into reading Die Bibliothek als &ouml;ffentlicher 
              Ort und &ouml;ffentlicher Raum, the latest offering of the publisher 
              BibSpider, that I realised that I was living within 8km of a library 
              that presented a prime example of what the book was advocating. 
              The theme of the book is that libraries need to be re-invented in 
              order to meet the challenges of the changing technological and social 
              climate. The library in question, the Central Library of the city 
              of Norwich in the East of England, had, as a result of dramatic 
              circumstances, been forced to re-invent itself in the 1990s.</p>
            <p class="text">The Central Public Library, Norwich, built in the 
              1960s, was destroyed by fire in 1994. This event made it into the 
              national news and there was a photograph of the burning building 
              on the front page of The Times. Who said libraries were not important? 
              While the site was subject to intense archaeological investigation 
              (artefacts were found from the time of the Viking invasions and 
              right through the Middle Ages), there was a considerable amount 
              of debate about what form the library would take when it was re-built. 
              In the end it was decided that the building to be constructed would 
              contain, not only the Central Library, but would be so constructed 
              that other organisations could be housed within it, together with 
              space being provided for exhibitions and other events.</p>
            <p class="text"> Work began on the new building in October 1999 and 
              it was opened to the public in November 2001, with an official opening 
              by the Queen the following year.</p>
            <p class="text">The Central Library is now called the Millennium Library 
              and is part of a complex known as the Forum. In front of the building 
              is an open space in the form of a mini-amphitheatre. During the 
              Christmas season it is turned into an ice rink. Beneath the building 
              is a car park. Consideration was given to the special needs of disabled 
              people, with ramps for access and lifts to all floors.</p>
            <p class="text">The Forum is run by a Trust that organises events 
              both inside and outside the building throughout the year. These 
              vary from a farmer&#8217;s market, fashion shows, antiquarian book 
              fairs, exhibitions, to concerts. The Millennium Library runs its 
              own events &#8211; for example, activities for children, Internet 
              taster, and teenage book groups.</p>
            <p class="text">Within the main building there is a caf&eacute; bar, 
              complete with a grand piano for music while the patrons sip their 
              wine or coffee, a restaurant, tourist information centre, gift shop, 
              learning shop offering advice on courses throughout Norfolk County, 
              learning station specialising in IT courses, local newspaper shop, 
              and a cash machine. A large area is occupied by BBC East for local 
              radio and TV broadcasting. Every time I watch the local news on 
              my TV I see a picture of the Forum building introducing it, and 
              behind the newsreaders I can see people in the Millennium Library. 
              Perhaps the most unusual thing in the building is something called 
              Origins, spread over three floors and offering &#8216;an exciting 
              interactive journey through 2000 years&#8217; of local history.</p>
            <p class="text">What of the library itself? This is quite extensive 
              with shelving capacity to display 120,000 books, and, as well as 
              providing the usual lending and reference facilities, has a local 
              government information desk, a large picture collection charting 
              the history and development of Norfolk, plus free access to over 
              100 PCs for use for computer work, sending emails and providing 
              access to the internet. Computer access is available for people 
              with disabilities. CD Roms and a community information database 
              can be accessed. There are 220 study spaces. The library is open 
              to the public seven days a week.<br>

            <p class="text">An unusual feature of the library is a special collection, 
              the 2nd Air Division Memorial Library, founded in memory of American 
              service personnel who served in Norfolk and Suffolk during World 
              War 2. Money was raised by members of the 2nd Air Division following 
              the cessation of hostilities in 1945 to fund a library. The collection 
              comprises material on American culture and World War 2 in the air, 
              the emphasis being on the special relationship between the people 
              of the UK, specifically East Anglia, and the people of the USA. 
              When the library was re-opened in November 2001, some 200 US veterans 
              were among those attending the ceremony. </p>
            <p class="text">Some 2 million people visit the Forum each year. Its 
              striking appearance and location in the busy centre of Norwich means 
              it is a great attraction to locals as well as the many tourists 
              who visit the city. On the occasions when I have been there it has 
              always been busy and there has always been something new to see 
              and experience. During a recent visit I noticed that there was always 
              a queue at the general enquiry desk staffed by three librarians. 
              I gather that this is fairly normal.</p>
            <p><span class="text">Further information on the Forum, including 
              some excellent photographs of the building, can be obtained at www.theforumnorwich.co.uk 
              and on the library and its services at www.library.norfolk.gov.uk. 
              Better still, come and visit the ancient city of Norwich, twinned 
              with Rouen and Koblenz, and see for yourself.</span><br>
