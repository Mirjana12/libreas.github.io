              <p>John Wheatley College and Glasgow City Council Libraries are working 
              together to support information and learning services for local 
              people in the new Bridge development at the heart of Easterhouse, 
              a formerly very deprived area of Glasgow. Statistics give some idea 
              of the background of people living in one of the areas served by 
              John Wheatley College of Further Education where: 71 % above the 
              national norm of school leavers have no formal qualifications; 84 
              % above the national norm are unemployed; 70.8 % above the national 
              norm suffer from long-term sickness and ill-health; the average 
              household income is 26 % below national norm; 165 % above national 
              norm claim income support; car ownership is only 82 % of the national 
              level. The number of single-parent families is 66.7 % above the 
              national norm.</span></p>
            <p class="text">In the new Bridge facilities you can sit and read, 
              use the caf&eacute;, borrow books and DVDs or get high speed internet 
              access. Public library users and college students are able to take 
              advantage of the Glasgow City Libraries new REAL learning centre 
              and also of the College&acute;s flexible learning services. </p>
            <p class="text">The government is keen to promote joint use of libraries 
              and other shared-use buildings. The Bridge Cultural Campus contains 
              a new public library which includes the college library and flexible 
              learning unit, a new Arts Centre with a 250 seat auditorium, modernised 
              leisure and sports facilities, dance studio, caf&eacute;, recording 
              studio facilities. The new National Theatre of Scotland is based 
              here.</p>

              <p>For library services the partnership breaks new ground and poses 
              new problems. A monitoring project is being supported by the Scottish 
              Library and Information Council (SLIC). This will test and evaluate 
              the scope of the service level agreement to produce a model for 
              adoption elsewhere and will report in September 2007.</p>
            <p class="text">This joint use model promotes the library strategically 
              as a focus for community learning activities. The library design 
              uses a coffee shop, chill out seating areas, children&#8217;s play 
              areas and facilities for self-issue to create a welcoming ambience. 
              For delivery the service is managed jointly, under a service level 
              agreement, by the Glasgow City Council in partnership with the College. 
              College Library staff were transferred to the employ of the City 
              Council and the College buys back library services for its students.</p>
            <p class="text">Advantages apparent from the opening in autumn 2006 
              are: greater access to professional library support, purchasing 
              economies of scale, increased footfall and activity, enhanced library 
              related activities, more flexible opening hours, meeting spaces 
              and an informal caf&eacute; environment. On entering the library 
              you are immediately aware of a number of activities in different 
              areas; whether it is a book discussion group for adults or a poetry 
              competition for children. The stock is invitingly well displayed. 
              Publications from Glasgow City Libraries and John Wheatley College 
              are available for sale.</p>
