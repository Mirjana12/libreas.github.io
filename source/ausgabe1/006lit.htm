<p>The opportunity to be involved in the creation 
                of a library building must be one of the most exciting and rewarding 
                features of a librarian’s career, especially when the project 
                is over and the library is being well-used by an appreciative 
                public. Some public librarians have considerable experience of 
                building projects, including conversions and refurbished libraries, 
                although not perhaps of erecting a large or very large library, 
                while others have none or little at all. For everyone, however, 
                there is a first time, and while the librarian may well look forward 
                to the pleasure and the challenge of such an enterprise, they 
                may also feel less than well-prepared. In part this may be because 
                the planning and design of libraries was not addressed by the 
                librarian’s professional education, at least not in recent years.</p>

                <p>Each new public library building represents a unique amalgam of 
                the possibilities for library service and architectural and construction 
                practice. While some elements may be innovative and ground-breaking, 
                especially in a period of change, many fundamental planning and 
                design issues have to be considered time and time again from project 
                to project. This book does not purport to cover everything, or 
                to offer instant solutions but sets out and reviews those concepts, 
                issues, topics and options about which the librarian must be concerned 
                and which will need to be fully explored in the planning and design 
                process.</p>

                <p>Many of these topics, such as public library purpose, siting, 
                building size, the use of converted buildings, the deployment 
                of information technology, the preservation of library materials, 
                dual-use buildings and the working environment, often have a substantial 
                literature in their own right.</p>

                <p>The content of this book, therefore, can be seen as part of the 
                investigative, information-gathering process that precedes a firm 
                idea of what is wanted and expected of a proposed library building. 
                Its aim is to save the librarian's time, perhaps stop the reinvention 
                of the wheel on occasions, and to guide and enlighten the librarian's 
                thought processes in the belief that a better public library building 
                will result.</p>

                <p>In addition to concepts and issues, the book discusses also the 
                basic principles and practices of the planning and design of public 
                library buildings. These have been described at various times 
                in the past but necessarily need to be reiterated for today’s 
                librarians.</p>

                <p>The work is intended primarily for a British audience and records 
                matters that relate to that UK context. However, the experiences 
                and library buildings of other countries are drawn on and a number 
                highlighted as case studies. This wide-ranging coverage should 
                broaden its appeal to an international audience. The book demonstrates 
                that the UK continues to create public library service points, 
                both big and small, that enliven and shape its local communities 
                and that this is part of the world-wide public library scene.</p>
