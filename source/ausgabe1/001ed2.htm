<p>Although LIBREAS has not much to do with Candi 
                Stanton, in a certain way the motto is correct. The journal deals 
                with and about the library scientists' young generation, if we 
                might express ourselves with some emotion.</p>

                <p>This faculty of library science at the Humboldt University Berlin, 
                Germany is now 50 years old and has experienced quite a deal of 
                discussion as well inside as well outside the university environment 
                about the subject itself and therefore also about the existence 
                of the faculty which was endangered since the autumn of 2003 when 
                the university committee of the president proposed to close it 
                down - but there we are again - going strong.</p>

                <p>On February 15th, this year, the academic council of the Humboldt 
                University released the full professorship of library science 
                to the faculty, by doing this strengthening the faculty and the 
                subject library science. Thus the future is secured - but there 
                is much to do and especially among the students a great wish to 
                be and become active.</p>

                <p>LIBREAS is expressing this desire. It is not a mere student project 
                but one shaped by the students. It shall serve as an interface 
                between the young savages and the old hands, from the academic 
                and the professional environment, a public place for the dialogue, 
                for the exchange of ideas. Therefore it is called &#8220;Libreas- 
                Library Ideas&#8221;.</p>

                <p>Basically the journal shall become the journal which we, being 
                responsible for the content, want to read ourselves.</p>

                <p>LIBREAS shall be open, fresh and also controversial but also not 
                complete or finalized, in order to leave room for development, 
                to recognize niches in order to unfold trends out of them.</p>

                <p>We have looked for and found a partner BibSpider - Infonetworking 
                for libraries- not exactly a big Player, but also a kind of probe, 
                a nearly idealistic project, anticipated in proximity at the development 
                of the knowledge society.</p>

                <p>Now there it is - the first edition, born spontaneously and coloured 
                by the desire of being active. Surely there are faults to be found 
                and surely it will not meet all our claims. But we are delighted 
                by our first offspring and we are looking forward that this project 
                will grow and thrive- if you agree- we would be happy to see you 
                participating.</p>
