            <p class="text">At March 13, 2005 Michael Mandelartz from Meiji University 
              Tokyo referred in the Mailing List INETBIB to Austrian Literature 
              Online, which digitalizes each book, which cannot be traced or purchased 
              in any bookstore at Innsbruck. </p>
            <p class="text">In summer last year during a conference organized 
              by ICR (International Resource Centre of the US Embassy Berlin) 
              the library director of Harvard reported that in one or one year 
              and a half the total collection will be digitalized. Already today 
              college and university libraries in the United States are using 
              these collections if certain items in their own collection are lent 
              out or are as part of the reference collection not supposed to leave 
              the library building. The user from other institutions may chose 
              now to receive a bound copy (with a charge of around 20 dollars) 
              or the electronic form which is less costing. </p>
            <p class="text">
              These examples are mostly digitalized formats of printed books but 
              not electronic books which are offering quite different possibilities 
              for searches, linking and forms of depiction <br>
              As in most cases being observed the introduction of a new media 
              is followed by problems which have to be solved. This refers not 
              only to the technique in this case the reading devices but also 
              the format and the transmission of the E-Book. But also the organisation 
              and the place of the E-Book in the collection have to be taken into 
              consideration. The definition of the </p>
            <p class="text">E-Book by Daniela Zivkovic, Professor at the faculty 
              of philosophy, department of library and information sciences in 
              Zagreb, Croatia and having worked for a long time with the international 
              ISBN Agency will create a base for this topic. She is joined by 
              Mr. Peter Just, who just completed his Master Thesis at the Institute 
              or Library Science and the Humboldt University about the electronic 
              book and continues to be engaged in this topic.</p>

              <p>The electronic book is really not an academic topic but a new media, 
              which is going to conquer the market in the USA already. It will 
              enlarge information work of the libraries and will enable new possibilities 
              for libraries, e.g. the access to special collections. Voluminous 
              handbooks which often cannot be lent out should not be carried any 
              more and this will delight not only lawyers. But also sick and weak 
              patients will profit by them e.g. in the bibliotherapy. Lending 
              to other libraries will change and E-Learning as well privately, 
              on the site of the campus and during different continuing education 
              procedures.</p>

              <p>LIBREAS is delighted to present hereby some examples for further 
              discussion of this new media, which is going to influence in time 
              the collection development and the information work of libraries.</p>

              <p>For further literature on the topic &#8220;electronic book&#8221; 
              we refer to the elaborate bibliography from Chennupati K. Ramaiah, 
              which was published in &#8222;The Electronic Library&#8220; earlier 
              this year (Volume 23, Number 1, 2005, pp. 17-44).</p>
            <p><span class="text">Additionally you will find in LIBREAS&#8217; 
              current issue a short report on &#8220;INFODATA-eDepot&#8221;, a 
              project at Potsdam in LIBREAS, which collects and provides electronic 
              texts. Therefore it is no surprise to find i.e. Achim O&szlig;walds 
              interesting essay about the electronic book: E-Book-Angebotskonzepte 
              von Aggregatoren f&uuml;r Bibliotheken (2004). </p>

              <p>Because of Creative Commons the piece is distributed quite freely 
              on the web &#8211; a topic which refers to the crucial point of 
              electronic books: Digital Rights Management. D&ouml;rte B&ouml;hner 
              and Doreen Lutze put some thoughts on this subject and we put those 
              thoughts in the journal.</p>

              <p>A big unsolved question is yet the impact of electronic books and 
              publications on library architecture.
              A very ambitious approach is definitely Herzog &amp; De Meuron&#8217;s 
              &#8220;Informations-, Kommunikations- und Medienzentrum&#8221; (IKMZ) 
              in Cottbus. 
              It&#8217;s hard to answer to which extent they succeeded in being 
              a representation of environment shifting increasingly into a sphere 
              of electronic information, communication and multi media, so we 
              just apply to some &#8211; more or less personal &#8211; impressions.</p>

              <p>We very hope, you enjoy our second just &#8211; which of course 
              is quite a challenge for all not-german-speaking readers. If you 
              like to contribute something written in English please feel free

              <p>Anyway we look forward to receive your ideas, advices and suggestions 
              and remain with best regards from Berlin&#8217;s Institute of Library
