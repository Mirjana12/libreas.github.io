            <p class="text">So you think you might like to become a librarian?&quot; 
              (p. 65). While serving as an opening chapter on library management, 
              this query could do double-duty, with a slight change in punctuation, 
              as a statement of the overall theme of the book itself. Editors 
              Haycock and Sheldon essentially say as much in their Preface, wherein 
              they state, &quot;...this work is designed to be accessible, comprehensive, 
              and useful as an introduction to the work of the professional librarian&quot; 
              (p. ix). They add that this goal is to be met by the cadre of contributors 
              touching upon &quot;the knowledge, skills and abilities&quot; that 
              the modern day information professional is expected to possess, 
              as well as exposing the reader to &quot;...current and emerging 
              applications and trends and issues (ibid.).</p>
            <p class="text"> The writers as a whole have done a commendable job 
              in achieving their purpose. Those already in the field will immediately 
              recognize most of the names, as they have well established reputations. 
              Michael Gorman, for example, is a past President of the American 
              Library Association, while Richard E. Rubin is the author of a standard 
              textbook, Foundations of Library and Information Science, now it 
              its second edition.</p>
            <p class="text"> The material presented is divided into three broad 
              categories. &quot;Part I: Foundations, Values and Context&quot; 
              contains chapters on the history of librarianship, the ethical underpinnings 
              of the profession and the multitude of roles one has the opportunity 
              to play.</p>
            <p class="text"> &quot;Part II: Functions and Competencies&quot; takes 
              a look at the nuts and bolts of this career choice. Not surprisingly, 
              this entails reference work, marketing, management, reader's advisory 
              and other traditional aspects of what we do.</p>
            <p class="text"> &quot;Part III: Moving Beyond Boundaries&quot; peers 
              into our collective crystal ball in an attempt to discern what the 
              future holds. The emphasis here is on the already apparent drift 
              of events, such as the ever increasing interconnectedness of people 
              and places, i.e., the proverbial &quot;global village,&quot;: the 
              library as both literal community center and virtual resource treasure 
              trove, the ongoing evolution what we do and how we do it (read: 
              less face-to-face contact with patrons, more techno-toys) and lastly, 
              issues of LIS education, such as the sometimes considerable gulf 
              between theory and practice (hint: what we are taught is how to 
              conduct a reference interview, what we experience are people whining 
              about the laptop computers they drag in).</p>
            <p class="text"> Rounding out the text is a very helpful set of appendices 
              - an even dozen - containing various resolutions and declarations 
              of professional associations (code of ethics, library bill of rights, 
              etc.), a section of citations to literature referenced in the individual 
              chapters, an index and an editors/contributors list containing biographical 
              sketches of each writer whose work appears in this title.</p>
            <p class="text"> With a minimum of jargon and a maximum of topics, 
              this book provides an excellent overview of librarianship as we 
              find in it in the early days of the twenty-first century. Anyone 
              contemplating this most contemplative of vocations would do well 
              to spend time with The Portable MLIS before striking out for the 
              other MLIS they can hang on their wall.<br>
