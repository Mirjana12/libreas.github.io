            <p><small>There rolls an Ikarus. <br>
                  Digging our photo archive for something to associate with &quot;Ikaros&quot; 
                  we came across this image of a so called <em>banana bus</em>, 
                  made in Hungary and driven all over Eastern Europe. So the public 
                  bus transportation draws a somewhat line from Prague to Berlin's 
                  Dorotheenstra&szlig;e, taking a imaginary detour via the Duna&uacute;jv&aacute;ros 
                  bus terminal. May Ikaros (as well as LIBREAS) stay online as 
                  long as Ikarus buses were built to be onroad!</small></p>
            <h3>Brief overview:</span></h3>
            <p class="text">Ikaros focuses on the Internet as a medium, a specific 
              communication environment and source of information. Articles which 
              focus on theoretical and practical aspects of Library and Information 
              Science (LIS) as well as book reviews and reports from various current 
              events in the field of LIS are to be found in the journal. Content 
              is mainly in Czech language with English abstracts and keywords 
              from year 2006. It is published on a monthly basis. The editors 
              of the journal also prepare special issues, especially issues containing 
              online coverage from LIS events (e.g., INFORUM conference in Prague, 
              Czech Republic).</p>
            <p><span class="text">The journal has started as a voluntary activity 
              by students of the Institute of Information Studies and Librarianship, 
              Faculty of Arts, Charles University, Prague (IISL, </span><a href="http://uisk.ff.cuni.cz/" target="_blank" class="back">http://uisk.ff.cuni.cz/</a><span class="text">) 
              in 1997 as a one of the first electronic journals with ISSN registered 
              in Czech Republic and has always been available only in the electronic 
              format. Since October 1999 the content of the journal has been made 
              available at </span><a href="http://www.ikaros.cz/" target="_blank" class="back">http:/www.ikaros.cz</a> 
              <span class="text">(previously, it was located at </span><a href="http://ikaros.ff.cuni.cz/" target="_blank" class="back">http://ikaros.ff.cuni.cz/</a><span class="text">). 
              Since November 2000 the journal has been published by Ikaros, o. 
              s., an NGO registered at the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic.</span></p>
            <p class="text">Ikaros belongs to the most influential journals in 
              LIS in the Czech Republic with very high Page Rank. With a tradition 
              of more then ten years, the journal can now be considered mature 
              but it is also a welcoming place for student work. For example, 
              a growing number of students who graduate at the IISL decide to 
              publish selected parts of their theses in Ikaros. It is a win-win 
              situation in which the young author gains a certain recognition 
              in the professional community and, at the same time, Ikaros has 
              a unique opportunity to become an integral part of an education 
              process.</p>
            <h3>Content management system:</h3>
            <p><span class="text">From a website containing only static pages 
              (in the humble beginnings of its existence in 1997) Ikaros has changed 
              into a dynamic website. First, a proprietary content management 
              system (CMS) was used. Then, as the number of open-source CMSs has 
              risen and their quality has significantly improved, a decision was 
              taken to start using a new CMS which would offer new features and 
              simplify the implementation of changes in the future. After a careful 
              examination of currently available open-source CMSs (which took 
              place in late 2005), Drupal (</span><a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank" class="back">http://drupal.org/</a><span class="text">) 
              was chosen. Roman Ch&yacute;la, our webmaster, then prepared a special 
              e-journal module for Drupal (it is now available for download at 
              </span><a href="http://drupal.org/node/46485" target="_blank" class="back">http://drupal.org/node/46485</a><span class="text">) 
              and, in cooperation with the editorial board, made a smooth transition 
              from the previous CMS to the new one. The first issue created in 
              the new CMS was the issue published on 1st March 2006 (</span><a href="http://www.ikaros.cz/ejournal/1/112" target="_blank" class="back">http://www.ikaros.cz/ejournal/1/112</a><span class="text">). 
              Since then new features are being added and existing features are 
              being improved. In this sense, we would like to emphasize that feedback 
              from our readers continuously proves to be a wonderful source of 
              inspiration for us. </span></p>
            <h3>Board:</h3>
            <p class="text">What is unique about Ikaros is, among others, the 
              way in which its editorial board operates. Although editors (currently 
              seven people including the editor-in-chief) regularly meet in person, 
              these meetings tend to be rather rare &#8211; they are organized 
              usually about four times per year. In the meantime, the collaboration 
              among editors is largely based on the use of information and communication 
              technologies. After all, content management systems can be configured 
              in such a way that the collaboration is even more effective than 
              the use of standard tools like e-mail or chat.</p>
            <h3>Projects:</h3>
            <p><span class="text">Virtual collaboration is also vital while working 
              on projects with many stakeholders. For example, in 2005 Ikaros 
              became involved in its first international project entitled Information 
              Society without Borders: Re-Establishing and Development of the 
              Cross-Border Cooperation within the Information Studies and Librarianship. 
              In this project partners from four countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
              Hungary, and, last but not least, Poland) joined their forces to 
              create the outputs (articles and biographies of important personalities 
              from LIS history) that can now be found at </span><a href="http://www.ikaros.cz/projekt_ivf" target="_blank" class="back">http://www.ikaros.cz/projekt_ivf</a><span class="text">. 
              The project has also resulted in developing new friendships and 
              contacts and we will be happy to continue in mutual cooperation 
              on other projects in the future.</span></p>
            <h3>Special services:</h3>
            <p><span class="text">In the past we used to publish conference proceedings 
              online. Since 2001 each May when the Inforum</span> <span class="text">conference 
              (</span><a href="http://www.inforum.cz/" target="_blank" class="back">http://www.inforum.cz/</a><span class="text">) 
              is held in Prague we run the live stream from the conference. We 
              also provide our users with a continuous coverage of the conference 
              events (especially pre-conference workshops and talks given at the 
              conference) and we accompany these bits of news with photographs 
              taken at the conference. Some special recordings from the last conference 
              in 2008 &#8211; interviews with speakers and other relevant conference 
              participants - are available online at:</span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=13B99DCE07623CE2" target="_blank" class="back">
