            <h3>THE LIBRARY SCIENCE QUESTION</h3>
            <p class="textrot"><strong>LIBREAS:</strong> You may have heard about 
              the discussion within our institute about the state of Library Science 
              and the question whether there should be a &#8222;library&#8221; 
              in the department&#8217;s name at all. We would like to know your 
              opinion concerning this question: Is there something like a Library 
              Science and if yes &#8211; what is it about?</p>
            <p><span class="text"><strong>Myoung WILSON:</strong> From my experience 
              and that way I look at I think library is more services. If you 
              go into information studies where you&#8217;re involved in systems, 
              systems design and information retrieval you have something like 
              scientific studies. But if you are talking about general libraries 
              I look at them as more of a service so if you&#8217;re talking of 
              Library Studies and Information Science this is closer to what it 
              is than &#8222; Library Science&#8221;. My old school at the University 
              of Michigan was called &#8220;School of Library Science&#8221; but 
              I think they changed the name to &#8222;School of Information&#8221;. 
              This is something I can agree.</span> </p>
            <p class="textrot"><strong>LIBREAS:</strong> This is what we did here 
              in Berlin as well. There was even the idea of changing it into something 
              like &#8220;Institute of Knowledge Organization&#8221;&#8230; </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Myoung WILSON:</strong> This is even very 
              further advanced. But &#8222;Library Studies and Information Science&#8221; 
              implies to me knowledge management and knowledge organization &#8211; 
              because you can&#8217;t just do the knowledge organization without 
              the knowledge managing &#8211; so it would be to narrow. You would 
              have to say &#8222; Knowledge Management and Knowledge Organization&#8221;.

            <h3>THE FIRST TIMER QUESTION</h3>
            <p class="textrot"><strong>LIBREAS: </strong>Do you remember the first 
              time you&#8217;ve been to a library means your first &#8222;library 
              experience&#8221;?</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Myoung WILSON:</strong> Well, I grew up and 
              was educated in Korea until college and at that time I never really 
              used reference services at the library. The library was a study 
              hall as most undergraduate students think the library is a study 
              hall. My first realization that the library is more than a study 
              hall is when I came to graduate school at Penn State which is way 
              too late. There I saw all this reference tools and there for the 
              first time I asked a question to a reference librarian: &#8222;How 
              do I find out to use newspapers?&#8221; and I was told to use the 
              New York Times Index. I still remember that reference room at Penn 
              State University in State College in Pennsylvania and I remember 
              that I just said &#8222; Wow!&#8221; And than as I spend so many 
              times in the libraries doing my studies I decided to become a librarian.
