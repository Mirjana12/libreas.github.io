            <p>Not least due to pick some of this year&rsquo;s IFLA WLIC  experiences of the LIBREAS editorial board in far South Korea we are glad to present  some notes on librarianship and libraries&rsquo; everyday life in more or less  distant countries.</span></p>
            <p class="text">Thus libraries in Japan have a long tradition. The  first library was found in the 6th resp. 7th century  followed by numerous libraries for the court, priests and scholars. Stephanie  Kaiser provides some overview on the development of Japan librarianship and goes into  details concerning different library types.</p>
            <p class="text">It&rsquo;s a matter of common knowledge that South Korea is impressively  becoming a highly modern country accompanied by a powerful economy as well as  being conscious in its traditions. During our stay for IFLA WLIC we received an  impression of this intense development&rsquo;s dimension. As expected this view tends  to be subjective &ndash; therefore we are glad to provide a &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s eye perspective&rdquo;  by Andreas M&uuml;ller-Lee, who is a Korean Studies researcher.</p>
            <p class="text">The country with the least orthodox exposure to the  traditional library ideal is probably Singapur which made the headlines due to  the liberalization of the chewing gum prohibition: Meanwhile pharmacies are  allowed to dispense chewing gum as long as they are registering the customers. From  time to time after improvidently touching underneath the table top as a German  reading room user one is almost longing to the South Asian country. Anyway  Bernhard Mittermaier has been there &ndash; likely for other reasons &ndash; and presents  the ambitious library@esplanade as a library in a cultural center with  remarkable equipment and tempting offers.</p>
            <p class="text">Not only geographically Poland  is very closer to Germany  at all. Just only one hour away from Berlin  you can sit down in the public library of the little border town Slubice. The  contribution of Stephanie Funk is recommended to all, who are interested in  getting a general idea of the Polish librarianship before then schmoozing with  the local librarians.</p>
            <p class="text">Elke Greifeneder also had some talks to librarians  during her study visit to France  inspiring her to reflect the relationship between man and machine.</p>

            <p>In Iceland the whole country seems to be a library &ndash;  having at least an internet access which enables to see by www.hvar.is about  8,500 complete journals from the own kitchen table. The country is also  remarkable for other reasons. Here you can find the highest per capita volume  of publications at all. Besides the high quality of life Anika B&auml;cker describes  what Island offers concretely in the field of  librarianship.</p>

            <p>A short time ago Myoung Wilson from the Rutgers University visited Humboldt-<em>University</em><em> and just talking to her the editorial staff of  LIBREAS also had two questions. As a result we took the answers of Myoung  Wilson to open our new column &ldquo;Short cuts&rdquo;.</em></p>

            <p>Even more time than with Myoung Wilson we &ndash; as students  of the Institute - spent talking with Professor Walther Umst&auml;tter. And by the  way: So we also did being the editorial board of LIBREAS. You can read how and  why we did this in the interview protocols of this issue. </p>

            <p>According  to Georg Olms the book has a future. Ben Kaden also thinks in that way. But as  the opinion paper &ldquo;Von der Vielfalt und der Einfalt der Medien&ldquo; (&bdquo;From  diversity and mindedness of media&ldquo;) shows, perspectives  are sometimes rather different.</p>

            <p>Elisabeth Simon shows that there is sometimes libraries  not only gut soul but all kinds of music to be played in. And she demonstrates  how the library could be used actively to convey social qualities.</p>

            <p>Poetry has not to tell the plain truth. But it must be  able to strike a light. Susanne Brandt shows us such a light by the German adaptation  of &ldquo;Wild about books&rdquo;. It is warmly recommended to read it together with the  own children. The second poem by Susanne Brandt is more directed to the fellow  librarians. Because we appreciate lyrics and even more library lyrics the gift voucher from our quiz is given  to her. </p>
            <p class="text">Finally there is the usual convolute of reviews and a  short photo collection illustrating our impressions from Seoul.</p>

            <p>We apologize for the short delay of this issue und we very hope to be untroubled by such a technical breakdown that we had while  making this LIBREAS issue.</p>

            <p>Please do not hesitate to send us your criticism,  commendation, comments, proposals for contributions and subjects.</p>
